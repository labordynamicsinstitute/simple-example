	 	We discuss identification with tribes in  Alaska.

	 How many people identify with only one of the four tribes in Alaska?  In order to address this question, we use data from the Census of Population and Housing \citep{10.3886/icpsr13568.v1}. The four tribes coded within the Census of Population for Alaskan Natives are Alaskan Athabascan, Aleut, Eskimo, and Tlingit-Haida. We identify all respondents who specified only those tribal identities, without combining them with additional identifiers.
	 
	 Table~\ref{freq_specific_ak} shows the results.
